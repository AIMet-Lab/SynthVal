===============================

.. py:class:: metrics.MeanMahalanobisDistance

   Bases: :py:obj:`SimilarityMetric`


   Similarity Metric computing the mean of the estimated Mahalanobis Distances between all the samples
   of the P distribution and the Q distribution (the estimation is due to the use of the numpy.cov method
   to compute the covariance matrix of the Q distribution).



   .. py:method:: calculate(dist_p_df, dist_q_df)

      Compute an estimation of the Mahalanobis Distance between two distributions as a mean of
      the Mahalanobis Distance computed over each sample of the first against the second.

      :param dist_p_df: Set of samples representing distribution P.
      :type dist_p_df: pandas.DataFrame
      :param dist_q_df: Set of samples representing distribution Q.
      :type dist_q_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: * **out** (*float*)
                * *The estimated mean Mahalanobis Distance.*
