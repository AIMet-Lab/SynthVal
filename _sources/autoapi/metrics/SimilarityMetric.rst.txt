metrics.SimilarityMetric
========================

.. py:class:: metrics.SimilarityMetric

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   Abstract base class representing a generic similarity metric between two sets of samples originating from
   two multivariate distributions.
   Child classes must implement the concrete `calculate` method for computing the specific metric.



   .. py:method:: calculate(dist_p_df, dist_q_df)
      :abstractmethod:


      Abstract method to compute a metric of similarity between two set of samples originating from two multivariate
      distribution P and Q.

      :param dist_p_df: Set of samples representing distribution P.
      :type dist_p_df: pandas.DataFrame
      :param dist_q_df: Set of samples representing distribution Q.
      :type dist_q_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: The value of the metric.
      :rtype: float
