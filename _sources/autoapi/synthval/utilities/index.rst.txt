synthval.utilities
==================

.. py:module:: synthval.utilities

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Module providing utility functions and classes for handling image datasets and feature extraction.

   This module contains utility functions for image processing, such as converting DICOM and other image formats to
   PIL Images, and managing datasets of extracted features for training and testing. The dataset management is
   integrated with pyNeVer's training and testing strategies.

   Functions
   ---------
   get_stream_logger(logger_origin: str) -> logging.Logger
       Utility function to instantiate a stream logger.
   get_pil_image(image_path: str) -> PIL.Image.Image
       Utility function to convert a DICOM or generic image file to a PIL Image.

   Classes
   -------
   FeaturesDataset(pynever.datasets.Dataset)
       A dataset class for managing features extracted from original and synthetically generated images for use in
       PyNEVER training and testing.
