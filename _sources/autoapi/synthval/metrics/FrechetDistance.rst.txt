synthval.metrics.FrechetDistance
================================

.. py:class:: synthval.metrics.FrechetDistance(eps = 1e-06)

   Bases: :py:obj:`SimilarityMetric`


   Similarity Metric that computes the Frechet distance (also known as Fr√©chet Inception Distance) between two
   distributions by comparing their means and covariances.

   When applied to features extracted from the last average pooling layer of the Inception model (e.g., those provided
   by synthval.features_extraction.InceptionExtractor), it corresponds to the standard Frechet Inception Distance.


   .. attribute:: eps

      Small offset added to the covariance matrices to handle numerical issues such as matrix singularity
      (default: 1e-6).

      :type: float, Optional

   .. py:method:: calculate(dist_p_df, dist_q_df)

      Compute the Frechet distance between two distributions by comparing the mean and covariance of the samples
      provided.
