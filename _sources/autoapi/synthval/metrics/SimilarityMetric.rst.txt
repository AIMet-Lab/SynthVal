synthval.metrics.SimilarityMetric
=================================

.. py:class:: synthval.metrics.SimilarityMetric

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   Abstract base class representing a generic similarity metric between two sets of samples originating from
   two multivariate distributions.
   Child classes must implement the concrete `calculate` method for computing the specific metric.



   .. py:method:: calculate(real_dist_df, synth_dist_df)
      :abstractmethod:


      Abstract method to compute a metric of similarity between two set of samples originating from two multivariate
      distribution real_dist and synth_dist.

      :param real_dist_df: Set of samples representing distribution real_dist.
      :type real_dist_df: pandas.DataFrame
      :param synth_dist_df: Set of samples representing distribution synth_dist.
      :type synth_dist_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: A numpy array containing the value (or values) of the metric.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray
