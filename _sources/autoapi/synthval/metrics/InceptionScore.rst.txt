synthval.metrics.InceptionScore
===============================

.. py:class:: synthval.metrics.InceptionScore(num_splits = 10)

   Class for computing the Inception Score over a set of probabilities.

   The Inception Score measures the quality of images generated by generative models (such as GANs) by evaluating the
   entropy of predictions made by the Inception model. Higher scores correspond to generated images that are both
   diverse and sharp. As suggested by the authors of the reference paper, this metric should be computed over a
   sufficiently large number of samples (at least 50,000).

   .. attribute:: num_splits

      Number of splits to use for the probabilities. This is used to compute the score on different subsets of
      the data and obtain a more robust estimate of the score (default: 10).

   .. py:method:: calculate(probabilities_df)

      Compute the Inception Score over the provided probabilities.

      The score is computed by evaluating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the conditional class
      distribution for each generated image and the marginal class distribution across the dataset. The exponential
      of the average KL divergence is the Inception Score. The mean and standard deviation of the score are calculated
      over multiple splits of the data for robustness.

      :param probabilities_df: DataFrame containing the predicted class probabilities for each generated sample. The probabilities are
                               typically obtained from a pre-trained Inception model.
      :type probabilities_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: * **score_mean** (*float*) -- The mean of the computed Inception Scores across the splits.
                * **score_std** (*float*) -- The standard deviation of the Inception Scores across the splits.
