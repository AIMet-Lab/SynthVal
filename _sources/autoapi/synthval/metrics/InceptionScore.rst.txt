synthval.metrics.InceptionScore
===============================

.. py:class:: synthval.metrics.InceptionScore(num_splits = 10)

   Concrete Class for computing the Inception Score over a set of given probabilities. As proposed in:
   https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/8a3363abe792db2d8761d6403605aeb7-Paper.pdf.
   As suggested from the authors, this metric should be evaluated only on a large enough number of samples
   (i.e., >= 50k).

   .. attribute:: num_splits

      Number of splits to use for the probabilities.

      :type: int, Optional


   .. py:method:: calculate(probabilities_df)

      Compute the inception score over a set of probabilities provided as parameter.

      :param probabilities_df: Set of probabilities over which to compute the inception score.
      :type probabilities_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: **out** -- Contains the mean and the standard deviation of the computed scores.
      :rtype: typing.Tuple
