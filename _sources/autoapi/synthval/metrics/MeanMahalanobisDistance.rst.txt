synthval.metrics.MeanMahalanobisDistance
========================================

.. py:class:: synthval.metrics.MeanMahalanobisDistance

   Bases: :py:obj:`SimilarityMetric`


   Similarity Metric computing the mean of the estimated Mahalanobis Distances between all the samples
   of the real_dist distribution and the synth_dist distribution (the estimation is due to the use of the numpy.cov
   method to compute the covariance matrix of the synth_dist distribution).



   .. py:method:: calculate(real_dist_df, synth_dist_df)

      Compute an estimation of the Mahalanobis Distance between two distributions as a mean of
      the Mahalanobis Distance computed over each sample of the first against the second.

      :param real_dist_df: Set of samples representing distribution real_dist.
      :type real_dist_df: pandas.DataFrame
      :param synth_dist_df: Set of samples representing distribution synth_dist.
      :type synth_dist_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: A numpy array containing the estimated mean Mahalanobis Distance.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray
