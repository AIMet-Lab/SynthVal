====================================

.. py:class:: synthval.metrics.WassersteinDistance

   Bases: :py:obj:`SimilarityMetric`


   Similarity Metric computing the Wasserstein Distance.



   .. py:method:: calculate(real_dist_df, synth_dist_df)

      Compute the Wasserstein Distance between two set of samples originating from two
      multivariate distribution real_dist and synth_dist.

      :param real_dist_df: Set of samples representing distribution real_dist.
      :type real_dist_df: pandas.DataFrame
      :param synth_dist_df: Set of samples representing distribution synth_dist.
      :type synth_dist_df: pandas.DataFrame

      :returns: A numpy array containing the value of the Wasserstein Distance.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray
