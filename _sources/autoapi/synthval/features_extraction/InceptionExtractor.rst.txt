synthval.features_extraction.InceptionExtractor
===============================================

.. py:class:: synthval.features_extraction.InceptionExtractor(model_id, get_probabilities = False)

   Bases: :py:obj:`FeatureExtractor`


   Feature extractor using traditional Inception models from the timm library (https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/index).
   Supports batch processing and provides options to extract feature embeddings or class probabilities.


   .. py:method:: batch_feature_extraction(images)

      Extract features (or probabilities) from a batch of images using the Inception model.

      :param images: List of PIL images to extract features from.
      :type images: List[PIL.Image.Image]

      :returns: A NumPy array where each row corresponds to the feature vector (or probability vector) of an image.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray
