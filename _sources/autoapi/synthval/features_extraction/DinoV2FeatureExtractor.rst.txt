===================================================

.. py:class:: synthval.features_extraction.DinoV2FeatureExtractor(model_id)

   Bases: :py:obj:`FeatureExtractor`


   Feature extractor using models from the HuggingFace DinoV2 family
   (https://huggingface.co/collections/facebook/dinov2-6526c98554b3d2576e071ce3).

   Note: As of December 16, 2024, Dino models utilize the operator `aten::upsample_bicubic2d.out`,
   which is not currently supported on the MPS backend. To use these models as feature extractors
   on MPS, users must set the environment variable `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK` to `1`.

   .. attribute:: model_id

      HuggingFace model ID for the selected DinoV2 model.

      :type: str


   .. py:method:: feature_extraction(image)

      Extract features from a PIL image using the selected HuggingFace DinoV2 model.

      :param image: The image to extract features from.
      :type image: PIL.Image.Image

      :returns: A 1-D NumPy array. The number of features depend on the specific model: 384 for small, 768 for base,
                1024 for large, and 1536 for giant.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray
