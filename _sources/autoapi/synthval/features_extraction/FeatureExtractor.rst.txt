synthval.features_extraction.FeatureExtractor
=============================================

.. py:class:: synthval.features_extraction.FeatureExtractor

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   Abstract base class representing a generic feature extractor.
   Child classes must implement the batch_feature_extraction method for batch processing.


   .. py:method:: batch_feature_extraction(images)
      :abstractmethod:


      Abstract method to extract features from a batch of images.

      :param images: List of PIL images to extract features from.
      :type images: List[PIL.Image.Image]

      :returns: A NumPy array containing extracted features for the batch.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray



   .. py:method:: group_feature_extraction(source_folder_path, batch_size = 16, verbose = True)

      Extract features from all images in a specified folder using batch processing.

      :param source_folder_path: Path to the folder containing images.
      :type source_folder_path: str
      :param batch_size: Number of images to process in a single batch (default: 16).
      :type batch_size: int, optional
      :param verbose: If True, logs progress during extraction (default: True).
      :type verbose: bool, optional

      :returns: A DataFrame containing extracted features for all images.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame



   .. py:method:: get_features_df(source_folder_path, save_path = None, batch_size = 16, verbose = True)

      Extract features from images in a folder and optionally save them to a CSV file.

      :param source_folder_path: Path to the folder containing images.
      :type source_folder_path: str
      :param save_path: Path to save the features DataFrame as a CSV file. If a CSV file exists, it will be loaded instead.
      :type save_path: str, optional
      :param batch_size: Number of images to process per batch (default: 16).
      :type batch_size: int, optional
      :param verbose: If True, logs progress during extraction (default: True).
      :type verbose: bool, optional

      :returns: DataFrame containing extracted features for all images.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame
