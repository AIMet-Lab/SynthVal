===================

.. py:module:: features_extraction

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Module for feature extraction using various models from HuggingFace, including Rad-Dino, DinoV2, and MambaVision.

   This module defines abstract and concrete classes for feature extraction from images, leveraging different pre-trained
   models available through the HuggingFace library. The module supports extracting features from images using models such
   as Rad-Dino, DinoV2, and MambaVision, with each extractor providing methods for single and batch feature extraction.
