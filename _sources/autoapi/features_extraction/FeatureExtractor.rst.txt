features_extraction.FeatureExtractor
====================================

.. py:class:: features_extraction.FeatureExtractor

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   Abstract base class representing a generic feature extractor. Child classes must implement
   the concrete `feature_extraction` method for specific feature extraction.



   .. py:method:: feature_extraction(image)
      :abstractmethod:


      Abstract method to extract features from a PIL image.

      :param image: The image from which features are to be extracted.
      :type image: PIL.Image.Image

      :returns: A NumPy array containing the extracted features.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray



   .. py:method:: group_feature_extraction(source_folder_path, verbose = True)

      Extract features from all images in the specified folder.

      :param source_folder_path: The path to the folder containing the images.
      :type source_folder_path: str
      :param verbose: If True, log the progress of feature extraction (default: True).
      :type verbose: bool, optional

      :returns: A DataFrame where each row represents the features of an image.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame



   .. py:method:: get_features_df(source_folder_path, save_path = None, verbose = True)

      Extract features from a dataset of images and optionally save them to a CSV file.

      :param source_folder_path: Path to the folder containing the images.
      :type source_folder_path: str
      :param save_path: Path to save the features DataFrame as a CSV file. If a CSV file already exists at
                        the provided path, it will be loaded instead of recalculating features (default: None).
      :type save_path: str, optional
      :param verbose: If True, log the progress of feature extraction (default: True).
      :type verbose: bool, optional

      :returns: A DataFrame containing the extracted features.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame
